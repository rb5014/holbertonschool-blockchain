 * blockchain_difficulty - computes the difficulty to assign to

 * @blockchain: Pointer to the Blockchain to analyze
 * Return: Difficulty to be assigned to a potential
 *		   next Block in the Blockchain
 *
 * If the latest Blockâ€™s index is a multiple of
 * DIFFICULTY_ADJUSTMENT_INTERVAL, AND that it is not the Genesis Block,
 * the difficulty must be adjusted.
 * Otherwise, the difficulty of the latest Block in blockchain is returned
 * Difficulty adjustment:
 *		.Retrieve the last Block for which an adjustment was made
 *			(the Block with index <blockchain_size> - DIFFICULTY_ADJUSTMENT_INTERVAL)
 *		.Compute the expected elapsed time between the two Blocks
 *		.Compute the actual elapsed time
 *		.The difficulty must be incremented if the elapsed time is
 *			lower than half the expected elapsed time
 *		.The difficulty must be decremented if the elapsed time is
 *			greater than twice the expected elapsed time
 *		.The difficulty should not change otherwise
